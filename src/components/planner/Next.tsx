            </span>
            <br />
            During our testing session, we found that users don't usually
            right-click for customization options so we want to improve the
            visibility of that.

            Design is an ongoing process of iteration and improvement, I want to
            focus on collecting and listening to user feedback to enhance the
            end-user experience.

            Despite technical challenges, we aim to integrate dynamic elements
            into the plan page and create an efficient onboarding tutorial for
            the editor. Our goal is to enhance user navigation and minimize the
            learning curve.
