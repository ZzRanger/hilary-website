        I decided to conduct an online public survey to identified unique issues
        to Lezhin that users are currently facing

            After analyzing 22 survey responses, I discovered two main reasons
            that prevent users from using Lezhin:

          <div>
            <span className="font-bold text-[32px] tabular-nums">
              1. Poor App Experience
            </span>
            <br />
            Users experience various problems with the app. Compared to its
            competitorsâ€™ apps packed with features such as personalized
            recommendations and customized user profiles, Lezhinâ€™s app is far
            inferior and lacks those features.

              2. Expensive Coin Models
            </span>
            <br />
            Lezhin does not offer longer free chapter periods, and users feel
            they are paying way too much for an inferior app.

                Students' confusion caused by varying college systems and degree
                requirements leads to advisors spending more time answering
                questions, resulting in delayed responses as they try to catch
                up with degree validation work.
