        I decided to conduct an online public survey to identified unique issues
        to Lezhin that users are currently facing

            After analyzing 22 survey responses, I discovered two main reasons
            that prevent users from using Lezhin:

          <div>
            <span className="text-[32px] font-bold tabular-nums">
              1. Poor App Experience
            </span>
            <br />
            Users experience various problems with the app. Compared to its
            competitorsâ€™ apps packed with features such as personalized
            recommendations and customized user profiles, Lezhinâ€™s app is far
            inferior and lacks those features.

            <span className="text-[32px] font-bold">
              2. Expensive Coin Models
            </span>
            <br />
            Lezhin does not offer longer free chapter periods, and users feel
            they are paying way too much for an inferior app.

                31.8% of the users surveyed said it is very important for Lezhin

                Students&apos; confusion caused by varying college systems and
                degree requirements leads to advisors spending more time
                answering questions, resulting in delayed responses as they try
                to catch up with degree validation work.
